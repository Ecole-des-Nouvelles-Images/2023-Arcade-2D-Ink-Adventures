<h1>Chroma</h1>
Introducing Chroma, a 2D platformer-puzzle game largely inspired by *Inside*. Dive into the dark streets of a fading city, discover its inhabitants, use your light to navigate and open paths, progress, and retrieve the lost light of the town.<br><br/>

<h2>The Team</h2>
This game was developed by a four-person crew as part of a project during our second year at L'École des Nouvelles Images.<br><br/>

- <b>Giulia Perruca</b>, game artist. This project was their original idea.

<h2>Main Game Course</h2>
In this game, you control Chroma, the little lightbringer. You'll first need to collect all your colors to progress through the city. Unlocking all of them will provide you with new mixed colors that you will need to interact with or avoid certain objects during your adventure.<br><br/>

<h4>Starting the game</h4>
The first thing you'll need to do is dress up! As Chroma is a truly open-minded fashion fan, take the liberty to introduce him to your tastes. Change his clothes, but most of all, pick the best hat! <br><br/>

<h4>On to the adventure now</h4>
Once you've selected your best Sunday outfit, the next step is to get out of the house and explore the world. The first task will be to retrieve all the colors that will help you progress through the city: red, green, and blue. 
Acquiring all of them will be key to solving various platform puzzles. Learn to change your color to match the objects you want to interact with while avoiding the colors of objects that might block your way.
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
We highly recommend playing with a controller for this game. We also advise you to take your time to learn the mechanics, understanding which colors interact with which objects and which don’t. Keep in mind it's a puzzle game, so some situations might require a bit of reflection and timing!
